  <em>Free almost all of your GPU for what matters: Maximum latent space processing</em>

### WanVideoWrapper Integration

ComfyUI-MultiGPU now includes a custom, tightly integrated implementation for WanVideoWrapper, providing true multi-GPU support for advanced video generation workflows. Unlike the standard override nodes, these are bespoke wrappers that offer a more stable and feature-rich experience.

**Key Capabilities:**

*   **Load Models Anywhere:** Load different WanVideo models onto separate GPUs within the same workflow (e.g., Model 1 on `cuda:0`, Model 2 on `cuda:1`).
*   **Swap Blocks Anywhere:** Utilize any GPU as a target for offloading transformer blocks via the `WanVideoBlockSwapMultiGPU` node (e.g., swap to `cuda:2`).
*   **Reliable Device Tracking:** The device context is correctly managed even in complex dual-model workflows, ensuring the right model runs on the right GPU.

## The Core of ComfyUI-MultiGPU:
[^1]: This **enhances memory management,** not parallel processing. Workflow steps still execute sequentially, but with components (in full or in part) loaded across your specified devices. *Performance gains* come from avoiding repeated model loading/unloading when VRAM is constrained. *Capability gains* come from offloading as much of the model (VAE/CLIP/UNet) off of your main **compute** device as possible—allowing you to maximize latent space for actual computation.

1. **DisTorch Virtual VRAM for UNet Loaders**: Move UNet layers off your compute GPU  
   - Automatic distribution to RAM or other GPUs  
   - One-number control of VRAM usage  
   - Support for all GGUF models  

2. **CLIP Offloading**: Two solutions for LLM-based and standard CLIP models:  
   - **MultiGPU CLIP**: Full offload to CPU or secondary GPU  
     - Works for all CLIP models, including Single-, Dual-, and Triple-CLIP loaders and their GGUF variants  
   - **DisTorch Virtual VRAM CLIP**: Layer distribution for LLM-based CLIP (T5/llava-llama)  
     - Keeps compute on the main GPU for faster processing than a full offload  

3. **MultiGPU VAE**: Move VAE processing wherever you need it  
   - CPU or secondary GPU options  
   - Compatible with all major VAE types  
   - Flexible decode location  

**All components work together to maximize** your GPU’s available VRAM for latent space and efficient `compute`. The `custom_node` achieves this by modifying only **two** functions—one from **ComfyUI core** to make loaders “device-aware,” and the other from [ComfyUI-GGUF](https://github.com/city96/ComfyUI-GGUF) to allocate `GGML` layers for **UNet or CLIP** GGUF-quantized models.[^2]

[^2]: This custom_node modifies ComfyUI’s memory management behavior **only** while it is active. It does **not** alter Comfy core or ComfyUI-GGUF code on disk. When removed, ComfyUI reverts to normal. While functional for standard GPU and CPU configurations, edge cases may exist. You can crash your Comfy system if you use this node recklessly.


<h1 align="center">**NEW** DisTorch 2.0: Virtual VRAM Made Simple</h1>

  <br>
  <em>DisTorch 2.0 in Action</em>
</p>

## What's New?
DisTorch now features simple Virtual VRAM control that lets you offload model layers from your GPU with zero configuration. Just set how much VRAM you want to free up, and DisTorch handles the rest.

## How It Works
- **Virtual VRAM**: Defaults to 4GB - just adjust it based on your needs
- **Two Modes**:
  - **Default**: Offloads to system RAM
  - **Multi-GPU**: Distributes across other GPUs (optional)

## 🎯 Key Benefits
- Free up GPU VRAM instantly without complex settings
- Run larger models by offloading layers to other system RAM
- Use all your main GPU's VRAM for actual `compute` / latent processing
- Seamlessly distribute GGML layers across multiple GPUs if available
- Allows **you** to easily shift from ___on-device speed___ to ___open-device capability___ with a simple one-number change

  <em>DisTorch 2.0 Node with one simple number to tune its Vitual VRAM to your needs</em>
</p>

## 💡 Quick Start
1. Load any GGUF model using a DisTorch node
2. Set your Virtual VRAM amount (default: 4GB, in this example we chose 8GB)
3. Toggle "Use Other VRAM" if you have multiple GPUs[^3]
4. That's it!
[^3]:  DisTorch's Virtual VRAM aims to span as few a devices as possible. I recommend users try both ways (VRAM/DRAM) and see which works best for you.

## 🔄 Real-World Example
With a 12GB GPU running an 8GB model:
- Set Virtual VRAM to 4GB
- DisTorch moves 4GB of model layers to RAM
- Your GPU now has extra VRAM for larger batches, higher resolutions, or longer video

## 🚀 Compatibility
Works with all GGUF-quantized ComfyUI/ComfyUI-GGUF-supported UNet/CLIP models.

⚙️ Expert users: For those of you who were here for the 1.0 release of DisTorch, manual allocation strings still available for advanced configurations. Each log will contain the allocation string for the run so it can be easily recreated and/or manipulated for more sophisticated setups.
